How to softlink a file 

        ls  -s /home/dir1/dir2/filename softlink
        
        This will create softlink to file on current path
        
        If we deleted source file softlink file color will become red 
        
        ls  /home/dir1/dir2/filename hardlink
        
        This will create hard link for file and if we delete source hardlink shortcut will remain as it is
